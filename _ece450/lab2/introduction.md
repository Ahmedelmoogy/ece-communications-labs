In this lab, you will use Matlab to simulate a digital communication system.

You will learn about:

- Monte-Carlo simulations
- bit encoding
- maximum likelihood(ML) and maximum a posteriori detection (MAP)

## Deliverables

In this lab there are the following deliverables:

- a single page of answers to the deliverable questions laid out in the lab. In this lab there are 6 of them. They are all highlighted and labelled with their respective question numbers. Each question will require some thought and should be answered concisely with 1 to 2 sentences of text and perhaps an accompanying figure.
- a short code you write to generate a BER versus SNR curve
- your final BER versus SNR curve figure
