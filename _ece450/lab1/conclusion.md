In this lab, you:

- used GNU Radio to build a baseband BPSK communication system,
- made a histogram of the noisy received bits and related that the the bit error values,
- recorded BER values for several $$\sigma$$ values,
- wrote a short script to turn them into a $$BER-\sigma$$ curve.

## Deliverables

In this lab there are the following deliverables:

- a single page of answers to the deliverable questions laid out in the lab. In this lab there are 5 of them. They are all highlighted and labelled with their respective question numbers. Each question (hopefully) required some thought and was answered concisely with 1 to 2 sentences of text and perhaps an accompanying figure.
- a short code you wrote to generate a $$BER-\sigma$$ curves
- your final $$BER-\sigma$$ curve figure

Submit these three deliverables to your TA over coursespaces.
