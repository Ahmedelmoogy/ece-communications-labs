In this lab, you will use GNURadio to construct a baseband digital communication system including data source, pulse shaping, AWGN channel, receiver and bit error rate counter.

**If you are unfamiliar with GNU Radio, it is strongly recommended that you complete the [introductory GRC tutorials]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _GRC-tutorials/introduction.md%}) hosted on this site before trying these labs.**

You will learn about:

- pulse shaping
- timing recovery in baseband receivers
- BER (bit error rate) measurements
- BER vs SNR

## Deliverables

TBD
