## Generating a BER curve

Using the values collected throughout this lab you can now generate a BER curve.

### Calculating SNR

- Remember from the textbook section 3.1.3.4 that the average power of zero-mean white noise is the variance [1].
- Remember that the amplitude of the noise generated using the
