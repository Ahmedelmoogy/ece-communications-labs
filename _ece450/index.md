## Introduction

This lab is meant to be a supplement to your ECE450 class. It will provide you with a way to explore the concepts and techniques discussed in class in a more hands on way. The course requires an SDR (software defined radio) as well as access to GNU Radio, Matlab and Simulink.

## Labs

- Lab 1 - 
- Lab 2 -
- Lab 3 -
- Lab 4 -

## Deliverables

The deliverables are different for each lab and are described at the beginning of each. There are no lab reports required.

## Asynchronicity

These labs are all designed to be done independently from a personal (or lab) computer. It is possible to complete the entire course's lab requirement without sitting through designated "lab hours". As such, you are encouraged to work at your own pace, **using the scheduled lab period as a time to get assistance from a TA or the course instructor**.
