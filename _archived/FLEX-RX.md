- What do you observe? With some patience, you should periodically see two strong lines that are 9.6 kHz apart with other weaker lines on either side (harmonics) as shown below. 9.6 kHz is the frequency shift used by the FLEX signal. The signal actually switches rapidly between the two frequencies, although the resolution of the waterfall is not fine enough to show this detail.

- You may also observe that the paging signal occurs in shorter bursts, as shown below.
